DESCRIPTION : 

    In this task, we explored how to meaningfully combine data from multiple database tables using different types of SQL joins—INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN—executed on the OneCompiler online platform. This allowed us to understand how each join retrieves and displays data based on the relationships between tables, such as customers and their orders. INNER JOIN returns only matching records, LEFT and RIGHT JOINs include unmatched data from one table, and FULL JOIN provides a complete view by merging both matched and unmatched records from both tables. These join operations are essential in real-world applications like business reporting, customer analytics, financial summaries, and data-driven web or mobile apps, where data is often distributed across related tables and needs to be merged for comprehensive analysis or display. Using OneCompiler made it convenient to simulate real database scenarios, test queries, and visualize outputs without setting up a local database environment.
